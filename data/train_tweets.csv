1067621586289795100,hadleywickham,2018-11-28T03:29:56Z,@ShriramKMurthi @PyretLang This makes me think of an unusual property of R: most users never create a custom type/class.
1067619096492167200,hadleywickham,2018-11-28T03:20:02Z,"@ShriramKMurthi Yes, and the defaults are chosen so that NAs always propagate (ie missingsy never go missing without explicit action)"
1067618645709398e3,hadleywickham,2018-11-28T03:18:15Z,@ShriramKMurthi Hmmmm I think missings early and often is a small hill I am willing to die on üòÄ. Especially since my sense is that missing handling isn‚Äôt domain specific.
1067615629937700900,hadleywickham,2018-11-28T03:06:16Z,"@ShriramKMurthi But I think there‚Äôs something about your comment that you leave it until they have stronger programming skills. I don‚Äôt think that applies to missing values in R, but I‚Äôm not sure why ‚Äî perhaps b/c built in funs all handle"
1067615158191693800,hadleywickham,2018-11-28T03:04:23Z,@ShriramKMurthi That feels a little inauthentic to me because missing data is so prevalent in real life. The first dataset I use always contains missings. (But obviously you have different priorities)
1067614812199370800,hadleywickham,2018-11-28T03:03:01Z,@ShriramKMurthi @PyretLang Can you share any code snippets? Eg computing a mean of a vector (possibly containing NA)?
1067613751862599700,hadleywickham,2018-11-28T02:58:48Z,"@ShriramKMurthi I‚Äôve written more type-related stuff at  but it‚Äôs mostly positioned wrt other R stuff, not other langs"
1067613397892702200,hadleywickham,2018-11-28T02:57:24Z,"@ShriramKMurthi In general, my sense is that richer/stronger typing forces you to think about more stuff upfront, which is both good and bad. But I don‚Äôt know about ways to teach that let you delay the concepts until needed"
1067613146049912800,hadleywickham,2018-11-28T02:56:23Z,@ShriramKMurthi I think it‚Äôs probably a reasonable approach for a general purpose lang with a rich type system. I suspect it might force you to think upfront about missing values in a way that is good for programming but possible annoying for data analysis
1067579019258982400,hadleywickham,2018-11-28T00:40:47Z,@ShriramKMurthi I would love to hear more about that

A full on rational system would basically be pointless for R. Missing values are vastly more important and are baked into few langs.

1067471081433415700,hadleywickham,2018-11-27T17:31:53Z,@guzdial @ClausWilke I think the problem is that the initial notebook doesn‚Äôt feel like a good faith attempt to understand R.

1067470320389562400,hadleywickham,2018-11-27T17:28:51Z,@guzdial I suspect we‚Äôre using lists to mean different things. In R you use lists to represent hierarchical data which I‚Äôm sceptical is a component of precaclulus

1065320379026038800,fchollet,2018-11-21T19:05:45Z,"Again, my scope when it comes to TensorFlow  Keras is very narrow. I‚Äôm just doing code review, looking at the tf.keras API. Sometimes I code. I do very little compared to everyone else, and hopefully I'll do even less in the future. I don‚Äôt enjoy the harassment on social media."
1065320378392731600,fchollet,2018-11-21T19:05:45Z,"Keras has implementations in TensorFlow, MXNet, TypeScript, JavaScript, CNTK, Theano, PlaidML, Scala, CoreML, and others I think? But I have only been involved with tf.keras and the TensorFlow/Theano implementation."
1065320377700642800,fchollet,2018-11-21T19:05:45Z,"One last misconception I see is that Keras is a TensorFlow wrapper library. In fact, Keras is an API standard for defining  training deep learning models, similar to what Gluon is to MXNet. Like Gluon, it's meant not to be tied to a specific implementation."
1065320376668848100,fchollet,2018-11-21T19:05:45Z,"In general, the TF team is quite large, with over 100 people (I think?), and none of them report to me. My scope is very narrow: looking at API changes within tf.keras, reviewing tf.keras code. That's really it."
1065320374773014500,fchollet,2018-11-21T19:05:44Z,"And then there are many more people elsewhere working on 3rd-party Keras implementations: the Keras-MXNet team at AWS, the Scala implementation from SkyMind, PlaidML, CoreML... As for me, I mostly do code reviews and I participate in design discussions."
1065320374131351600,fchollet,2018-11-21T19:05:44Z,"At Google, tf.keras (the internal TensorFlow implementation of the Keras spec) is made by 8 awesome engineers (come work with us!), and many more people contribute to it. And more great folks are working on the Keras TypeScript implementation as part of TensorFlow.js."
1065320373451862e3,fchollet,2018-11-21T19:05:44Z,"A misconception I see is that Keras is made or owned by me. I may have started it a long time ago, but nowadays I do very little compared to everyone else. keras-team/keras has 750 contributors, including a dozen of very active ones. The Keras repo exists thanks to them."

1032598529531891700,hadleywickham,2018-08-23T12:00:48Z,@rtelmore Ooh good idea. Let me think about it
1032509790767829e3,fchollet,2018-08-23T06:08:11Z,"@twitskeptic @earnmyturns The fact that DNA (with its limited capacity) can store generative programs for the body  brain is evidence that these systems are not very large in information terms, and that implies that the brain does not store much knowledge about the world, since that would be high-entropy"
1032503772193349600,fchollet,2018-08-23T05:44:16Z,"@earnmyturns However efficient the compression mechanism being used, and even taking into account the interaction with information that's external to our DNA, it remains that a pre-trained connectome would have a certain entropy, and that our DNA has limited entropic capacity."
1032477215789801500,fchollet,2018-08-23T03:58:45Z,"@benczheng Yes, our knowledge, as well as huge swathes of our intelligence itself (in particular most of what makes us special as humans compared to animals) are externalized in our civilization. It's not about individual brains, it's about the collective, past and present"
1032474589668896800,fchollet,2018-08-23T03:48:19Z,"That's also why it is of limited interest to study insect brains in order to understand cognition: understanding how brains can learn, and understanding how a specific connectome can generate complex behavior, are two independent, nearly unrelated problems."
1032472933451554800,fchollet,2018-08-23T03:41:44Z,"2) as brains change, so does the world; evolutionary scales (# of trials required by evolution as a search process) are too long to stumble upon adequate knowledge for the current state of world, so such knowledge would have to be limited to long-term invariants (which are few)"
1032472932054753300,fchollet,2018-08-23T03:41:44Z,"1) evolution is not conducive to producing knowledge (while it is good at finding behaviors), because the evolutionary advantage of any knowledge that's not immediately actionable (i.e. behaviors) is small"
1032447555106308100,fchollet,2018-08-23T02:00:53Z,@jeffgaisano Humans are not insects; the few megabytes of brain-related information in your DNA define *how to learn* but contain relatively little *knowledge* -- and only animal-like basics. (reasons: can't pass on knowledge via DNA; not enough space; evolutionary scales not long enough)
1032445365092409300,fchollet,2018-08-23T01:52:11Z,The next frontier is the top left corner.
1032437967829135400,fchollet,2018-08-23T01:22:47Z,"@malcgreaves Yes, that would be new and significant, but also almost certainly not doable with differentiable programming"
1032435493244293100,fchollet,2018-08-23T01:12:57Z,"It just moves the threshold for ""have we drawn enough data yet"" by a bit -- by no more than a few orders of magnitude. But when infinite data is available, this is ""just"" the size of your cloud computing bill."
1032435491281428500,fchollet,2018-08-23T01:12:57Z,"Thus, the question of failure or success boils down to ""have we drawn enough training data yet?"" (or in some cases, ""does our architecture have sufficient capacity  appropriate structure wrt the training data available?""). Whether the answer is yes or no, it teaches us nothing."
1032435490484498400,fchollet,2018-08-23T01:12:57Z,"Can differentiable programming learn arbitrarily complex behaviors, up to superhuman performance, given a dense sampling of the behavior manifold (e.g. an infinite training data generator, such as self-play)?

Yes. We knew that. Arguably AlphaGo was the concrete proof-of-concept."

1011035722936021e3,fchollet,2018-06-24T23:57:55Z,"@_onionesque I regularly do see this claim verbatim, with Turing-completeness being used as ""proof"". It's not a straw man, it's a surprisingly common position. Before RNNs were cool, the ""universal approximator"" argument was being used in the same way to say that NNs were sufficient for AGI."

1010993787265474600,fchollet,2018-06-24T21:11:16Z,"@volkuleshov It's also profoundly misleading to draw an artificial distinction between ""representation""  ""optimization"". The choice of an appropriate search space  encoding/structure for that space is the most important part of any search process. DL does not have an optimization problem."
1010989790139899900,fchollet,2018-06-24T20:55:23Z,"So statements like ""NNs are universal approximators (or, 'there are Turing-complete RNN architectures'), therefore DL has no limits"" is like saying ""you can use a pen  some paper to produce the complete works of Shakespeare"". Technically true, but pretty silly at the same time."
1010989041922109400,fchollet,2018-06-24T20:52:25Z,"Second, it is not relevant whether a program *can be represented* (that's almost always true), one care whether a program *can be developed* (not just in theory, but in practice) using a particular approach."
1010984890404253700,fchollet,2018-06-24T20:35:55Z,"@volkuleshov (Although, it would be pretty shocking if you could *not* come up with simple NN architectures that were Turing-complete -- Turing completeness is an extremely common property for any non-trivial data processing system.)"
1010981834069454800,fchollet,2018-06-24T20:23:47Z,"@volkuleshov No need for RNNs, a simple one-layer feedforward net is already a universal approximator. That statement is utterly useless, too, because only very simple programs can be *learned* from finite data in practice (every tried training a LSTM to sort arbitrary lists?)."

1010662308412919800,fchollet,2018-06-23T23:14:06Z,@vkhosla @BenedictEvans In short term we'll see a trend towards AI systems that blend handcrafted symbolic models of the world together with deep learning modules for perception/intuition (self-driving cars are a good example). But these are engineering-intensive.
1010466781041791e3,wesmckinn,2018-06-23T10:17:08Z,@johnmyleswhite in my experience in ASF projects (where all decisions must discussed / articulated in public forums) these meetings do take place but the important details justifying a decision are then written up and published

1010279897070104600,fchollet,2018-06-22T21:54:32Z,"Perhaps more importantly, although human engineers can cover a dramatically larger section of the space of interesting programs (compared to deep learning models), many useful programs remain inaccessible even to humans -- we cannot develop them by hand."
1010279371620274200,fchollet,2018-06-22T21:52:26Z,Most interesting processes cannot be learned by a stack of affine transforms (plus squashing functions) mapping one vector space to another point-by-point. Even given large amounts of data.
1010278944782708700,fchollet,2018-06-22T21:50:45Z,Deep learning is useful because it enables us to create programs that we could not otherwise code by hand. But the space of programs you can learn via deep learning models is a minuscule slice of the space of programs that we may be interested in.

Engagement and time spent are often adverse to the purpose of a product even on the lower end of the scale, and trying to maximize those is destructive for both products and users 100% of the time"

Moving along a pre-determined path with no freedom to make your own decisions, or no quick feedback on your decisions, is demotivating."

The term ""AI"" encourages people to think that our goal is to create artificial humans. In fact, automating cognition is not about replacing ourselves, it is about augmenting our capabilities."
994273929849024500,fchollet,2018-05-09T17:52:32Z,"Take any paper that make heavy use of such metaphors and replace the neuroscience vocabulary with the corresponding terms from mathematics or signal processing (e.g. ""fully-connected neural layer"" -&gt; ""affine transform""). It suddenly sounds very different. It cuts through the hype"
994273408627064800,fchollet,2018-05-09T17:50:27Z,The words we use to name things change our perception of those things independently of their actual nature. A lot of the hype and mystique around AI is due to our use of terminology from the fields of neuroscience and psychology.

985996234564427800,fchollet,2018-04-16T21:39:55Z,Corollary is that you can be extremely smart and extremely proficient at programming and still be a &lt;1x engineer
985995555280060400,fchollet,2018-04-16T21:37:13Z,"Came across a description of ""10x engineers"" as people with a superhuman affinity for reading/writing/debugging code. Hard disagree.

If you're working on the right problem and approaching it with the right data structures, you're a 10x engineer. The rest is filling in details."
985981863968702500,fchollet,2018-04-16T20:42:49Z,Interesting read. I've long wondered about this.
985957197321392100,fchollet,2018-04-16T19:04:48Z,"That doesn't mean trying to understand how the brain works isn't going to help us understand cognition. If anything, it can be an interesting source of inspiration.

But it means that's just one avenue among many. And I'd bet it's not the one that's going to get us there first."
985956463548878800,fchollet,2018-04-16T19:01:53Z,"Much like boolean algebra isn't fundamental to computing  programming in an abstract sense, but rather is an arbitrary low-level design choice, I don't think brains are fundamental to intelligence. I'd posit the most compact substrate for defining cognition is mathematics."
985946196333097e3,fchollet,2018-04-16T18:21:05Z,"@molecule61 Only if you buy it from the publisher directly, I think"

985678964633948200,fchollet,2018-04-16T00:39:12Z,"@jamwillz If you have reasonable Python programming experience, you can try with this book directly. Also, the book by Aur√©lien Geron is very good and approximately the same level of difficulty"
985634964237467600,fchollet,2018-04-15T21:44:22Z,"@mmxgn Yes, you can still leave a review (it won't be marked as a ""verified purchase"" review though)."
985632134424440800,fchollet,2018-04-15T21:33:07Z,"@JWood Thank you Jon, I'm glad it's useful to you!"
985631653283287e3,fchollet,2018-04-15T21:31:12Z,"If you bought my book from Amazon, know that all the reviews you write over there are appreciated. I value your feedback a lot! On top of it, these reviews help Amazon's ML algorithms make sense of the book. Gotta feed data to the beast :)"
985619973623070700,fchollet,2018-04-15T20:44:48Z,"@Grady_Booch We're still exploring the space of problems we can solve, but I think that was mostly 2014-2016 (while 2011-2013 was ""wow, it works""). DL is now a well-established solution for a certain scope of problems, but still a very inefficient one (data-inefficient, power-inefficient...)"
985609870689759200,fchollet,2018-04-15T20:04:39Z,"In AI, we're at stage 0 (groundwork). In deep learning, I'd say we're still at the ""make it efficient"" stage, so efforts to make it invisible  fully-automated may be premature in my opinion. We still need the monthly power consumption of a village to ""solve"" CIFAR10 from scratch"

985261484249759700,fchollet,2018-04-14T21:00:17Z,"@bkavoussi @jack @sriramk That's a good idea, but it would also be quite work-intensive."
985261183014809600,fchollet,2018-04-14T20:59:05Z,"Lots of replies to these tweets are along the lines of: ""you arrogant fascist, why do you hate discussion and debate and free speech"". I find immense value in open discussions, but seriously, if you think that's how Twitter replies are used, we must not be using the same app."
985217594230652900,fchollet,2018-04-14T18:05:53Z,"I wish we could post read-only tweets: no replies, not quote-tweets. Replies very rarely add value. @jack @sriramk please?"
985213684044652500,fchollet,2018-04-14T17:50:21Z,"If all you knew of humanity were a few kids from a hunter-gatherer tribe 100,000 years ago, would you still want to build human-level AI? An ant colony might start to look like it would be a lot better at optimization."
985213109664079900,fchollet,2018-04-14T17:48:04Z,"Hence the fascination for ""human-level intelligence"" in AI. What they mean is ""civilized human"", the intelligence of which is 95% the civilization and 5% the human"
985212489372655600,fchollet,2018-04-14T17:45:36Z,"As conscious subjects, we are extremely biased to believe that we owe our capabilities and our understanding of the world to our own individual intelligence. When in fact, we can do very little and we know very little on our own. It's collective intelligence all the way."

984529181135351800,fchollet,2018-04-12T20:30:23Z,"There's a quote by Alan Watts -- ""this is the real secret of life -- to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play"".

In that view, kids have life figured out. But then they forget."
984529019226865700,fchollet,2018-04-12T20:29:44Z,"Adults have their minds full of abstractions: other people and their mental states, future planning and worries, past memories... adults exist on a much wider plane, mostly made of non-things, or things that aren't here and now. They glaze over their surroundings."
984528815077539800,fchollet,2018-04-12T20:28:55Z,Another big one is presence and embodiment. The things you see and the things you don't see. Kids tend to be pretty focused on their immediate environment and the sensorimotor affordances it enables. Adult cognition is much more abstract and less embodied.
984528662690017300,fchollet,2018-04-12T20:28:19Z,"Another obvious difference is physical viewpoint. As a kid, you're a lot closer to the ground, and you perceive spaces as much larger. You're effectively living in a quite different physical space than the adults towering above you"
984528457869639700,fchollet,2018-04-12T20:27:30Z,"Thinking of some of the ways in which young kids (say, a 7 year-old) experience reality radically differently from adults. Late stages of development (and memories of going through them) are full of important insights about cognition"

984227489525383200,fchollet,2018-04-12T00:31:34Z,"3) Individual empowerment vs. mass manipulation. We should build products and systems that place the end user in control of the algorithms they interact with, rather than using AI to control people's opinions, choices, and lives. This is what I cover here:"

Moral wealth is wealth that's invested in the future. And all of the above categories have the potential to mis-invest in tragic ways."

Independently of who makes the decisions, you want available resources to be well-invested,  historically neither bureaucracies nor oligarchs have proven very good at that"
978691611642101800,fchollet,2018-03-27T17:53:58Z,@kcimc Wealth = resources to be invested. Doesn't matter as much who makes the investment as *what* you invest in.

976944685359956e3,kourtneykardash,2018-03-22T22:12:18Z,Time for spring cleaning! That means closets too...
976937775139180500,fchollet,2018-03-22T21:44:50Z,"@Grady_Booch Correct, but there's a huge difference between a passive newsfeed and a system that you actively query to find specific information. Also, in theory market incentives mean that the algorithm does optimize for being maximally useful to the user (otherwise they'd use another SE)."
976936344223211500,KimKardashian,2018-03-22T21:39:09Z,Applying perfect concealer at any age! Watch the full tutorial here:
976935081817251800,fchollet,2018-03-22T21:34:08Z,"As an industry, we need to develop product categories and markets where the incentives are aligned with placing the user in charge of the AI, instead of using AI to exploit the user's mind for profit or political gain. We need to strive towards products that are the anti-Facebook"
9.7693439983171994e+17,fchollet,2018-03-22T21:31:26Z,"As a side note, this is why products like Google search, Gmail, iOS, Android are beneficial while the Facebook newsfeed is destructive. The former are active, they empower users to do more, to know more. The latter manipulates your worldview and seeks to maximally waste your time"
976933782367293400,fchollet,2018-03-22T21:28:58Z,"AI will be our interface to the world -- a world made of digital information. This can equally lead to empowering individuals and communities to gain greater control over their lives, or to a total loss of agency. And regrettably, we're currently engaged on the wrong road"
976932503645601800,fchollet,2018-03-22T21:23:54Z,"It should be possible for users to configure their newsfeed to maximize learning and personal growth, for instance (or anything else). In that case, a more sophisticated AI, instead of being a threat, would be beneficial to you -- letting you achieve your goals more efficiently."
976931881831751700,fchollet,2018-03-22T21:21:25Z,"Rather than letting newsfeed algorithms manipulate us to achieve opaque goals (such as swaying your political opinions, or maximally wasting your time), we should put the user in control of the goals that the algorithms optimize for."
976931081399054300,fchollet,2018-03-22T21:18:14Z,"The problem is not so much that we are increasingly relying on algorithms to be our interface with an increasingly information-intensive world. With the rise of the Internet and AI, his trend is inevitable. The issue is control."

976808131966767100,wesmckinn,2018-03-22T13:09:41Z,Exciting development today: @ApacheArrow for Go
976804739944869900,fchollet,2018-03-22T12:56:12Z,"@Pinboard is how you keep in touch with your friends, and it can (does) use what your friends say in order to manipulate you (social reinforcement). Harder to avoid, far more insidious and far more effective"
976804336117297200,fchollet,2018-03-22T12:54:36Z,"@Pinboard Agree that YT has a problem (and I hope we'll see it fixed soon). But you can't compare YT to FB. Propaganda on YT is like propaganda on Fox News: it's strangers yelling at you on a screen, and you can just turn off the TV. FB, on the other hand, ... (Cont)"
976786099254181900,fchollet,2018-03-22T11:42:08Z,"So please get over the knee-jerk reaction ""all tech/advertising is bad"", and think about the contents of the thread. 

For me, working at Google is a deliberate choice. If I start feeling uncomfortable, I'll definitely leave. If I had been working at FB, I would have left in 2017"
976785289401135100,fchollet,2018-03-22T11:38:55Z,"There's only one company where the product is an opaque algorithmic newsfeed, that has been running large-scale mood/opinion manipulation experiments, that is neck-deep in an election manipulation scandal, that has shown time and time again to have morally bankrupt leadership."
976784465245515800,fchollet,2018-03-22T11:35:38Z,"Essentially nothing about the threat described applies to Google. Nor Amazon. Nor Apple. 

It could apply to Twitter, in principle, but in practice it almost entirely doesn't."
976783608219279400,fchollet,2018-03-22T11:32:14Z,About this thread. Some say this applies to Google too. This is the laziest kind of thinking -- just because two things share some superficial similarity (they're large tech cos) doesn't mean they're equivalent. Reminds me of pundits who kept saying HRC and DJT were just as bad

976569278328549400,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:20:34Z,"Who knows what will be next. It is quite striking that Facebook has been investing enormous amounts in AI research and development, with the explicit goal of becoming a leader in the field. What does that tell you? What do you use AI/RL for when your product is a newsfeed?"
9.7656910759100006e+17,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:19:53Z,"AI has been making fast progress in recent years, and that progress is only beginning to get deployed in targeting algorithms and social media bots. Deep learning has only started to make its way into newsfeeds and ad networks around 2016. Facebook has invested massively in it"
976568975302713300,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:19:22Z,"It is the reason why so many of the ads you see online seem desperately irrelevant. They aren't that sophisticated. Likewise, the social media bots used by hostile state actors to sway public opinion have little to no AI in them. They‚Äôre all extremely primitive. For now."
976568799141904400,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:18:40Z,"Until 2015, all ad targeting algorithms across the industry were running on mere logistic regression. In fact, that‚Äôs still true to a large extent today -- only the biggest players have switched to more advanced models."
976568706967851e3,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:18:18Z,"So, if mass population control is already possible today -- in theory -- why hasn‚Äôt the world ended yet? In short, I think it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre really bad at AI. But that may be about to change. You see, our technical capabilities are the bottleneck here."
976568588378153e3,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:17:49Z,"Importantly, mass population control -- in particular political control -- arising from placing AI algorithms in charge of our information diet does not necessarily require very advanced AI. You don‚Äôt need self-aware, superintelligent AI for this to be a dire threat."
976568469679358e3,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:17:21Z,"The human mind is a static, vulnerable system that will come increasingly under attack from ever-smarter AI algorithms that will simultaneously have a complete view of everything we do and believe, and complete control of the information we consume."
976568410287915e3,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:17:07Z,"In the case of the human mind, these vulnerabilities never get patched, they are just the way we work. They‚Äôre in our DNA. They're our psychology. On a personal level, we have no practical way to defend ourselves against them."
9.7656808009557606e+17,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:15:48Z,"Some of them have been used for a long time in advertising (e.g. positive/negative social reinforcement), but in a very weak, un-targeted form. From an information security perspective, you would call these ""vulnerabilities"": known exploits that can be used to take over a system."
976567871626031100,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:14:59Z,"This is made all the easier by the fact that the human mind is highly vulnerable to simple patterns of social manipulation. While thinking about these issues, I have compiled a short list of psychological attack patterns that would be devastatingly effective"
976567757109051400,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:14:31Z,"A good chunk of the field of AI research (especially the bits that Facebook has been investing in) is about developing algorithms to solve such optimization problems as efficiently as possible, to close the loop and achieve full control of the phenomenon at hand. In this case, us"
976567526023872500,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:13:36Z,"A loop in which you observe the current state of your targets and keep tuning what information you feed them, until you start observing the opinions and behaviors you wanted to see"
976565723597176800,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:06:26Z,"In short, Facebook can simultaneously measure everything about us, and control the information we consume. When you have access to both perception and action, you‚Äôre looking at an AI problem. You can start establishing an optimization loop for human behavior. A RL loop."
976565553761476600,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:05:46Z,"This is not quite news, as Facebook has been known to run since at least 2013 a series of experiments in which they were able to successfully control the moods and decisions of unwitting users by tuning their newsfeeds‚Äô contents, as well as prediction user's future decisions"
976565324622344200,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:04:51Z,"If Facebook gets to decide, over the span of many years, which news you will see (real or fake), whose political status updates you‚Äôll see, and who will see yours, then Facebook is in effect in control of your political beliefs and your worldview"
976565165922512900,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:04:13Z,"Integrated over many years of exposure, the algorithmic curation of the information we consume gives the systems in charge considerable power over our lives, over who we become. By moving our lives to the digital realm, we become vulnerable to that which rules it -- AI algorithms"
976564096605679600,fchollet,2018-03-21T20:59:58Z,"The world is being shaped in large part by two long-time trends: first, our lives are increasingly dematerialized, consisting of consuming and generating information online, both at work and at home. Second, AI is getting ever smarter."
976563870322999300,fchollet,2018-03-21T20:59:05Z,"The problem with Facebook is not *just* the loss of your privacy and the fact that it can be used as a totalitarian panopticon. The more worrying issue, in my opinion, is its use of digital information consumption as a psychological control vector. Time for a thread"
976557101995630600,fchollet,2018-03-21T20:32:11Z,"If there's one AI risk you should be worried about, this is it: extremely effective, scalable population control. And the fact that Facebook has been attempting to become a leader in AI is genuinely terrifying when you can see the full extent of the implications"

A high school student playing with NN frameworks in 2018 can develop stronger understanding of NNs in a matter of days -- just thanks to a better application context
971393697764880400,fchollet,2018-03-07T14:34:39Z,"@hardmaru It's perhaps clearer with a simpler example: implementing SVD teaches you how to implement SVD. Once you're done, you still don't know what it does.

Using SVD on various datasets and plotting  using the results is what gives you intuition about SVD. Also, learning math"
971392944702767100,fchollet,2018-03-07T14:31:40Z,"@hardmaru Knowing the algorithm != Knowing how/why it works.

My recommendation: do Kaggle competitions, and use more than neural nets. Use many different ML models. Make it visual. Plot your features."
971392497967513600,fchollet,2018-03-07T14:29:53Z,"@hardmaru Implementing neural nets teaches you how to implement neural nets. It gives you an algorithmic understanding of how they work.

It doesn't teach you what they do, or what they can or can't achieve. To learn that, you should apply them on a range of real problems (not XOR/MNIST)"
