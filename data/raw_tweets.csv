1090641954478600193,hadleywickham,2019-01-30T16:04:39Z,@BrodieGaslam That’s a strong claim to make given that data.tables mutate-in-place and add NSE to the method of a usually SE generic.

1090353383150505984,fchollet,2019-01-29T20:57:58Z,In general I expect ~90-95% of use cases to be covered by the Functional API. The Model subclassing API targets deep learning researchers specifically (about 5% of use cases).

1086023971710124034,hadleywickham,2019-01-17T22:14:26Z,@earowang Also support lubridate style h = days(1)? Are you using vctrs for the distribution type?
1086023612476391424,hadleywickham,2019-01-17T22:13:01Z,@earowang Or could model() be replaced by summarise() if it was a bit more flexible?
1086023438588960769,hadleywickham,2019-01-17T22:12:19Z,@earowang Using model() as a function name feels like a bit of a land grab. Maybe provide in a generics-like package? Or maybe could unify on something with tidymodels?
1086022663204675584,hadleywickham,2019-01-17T22:09:14Z,@earowang You might be able to avoid all the type stable suffixes by using vctrs. Purrr is likely to move in that direction later this year. (The animations are awesome!)
1086022321050185734,hadleywickham,2019-01-17T22:07:53Z,@earowang Should index_by take a purrr style anonymous function? Since the name of the time variable is stored in metadata?
1086022027989929986,hadleywickham,2019-01-17T22:06:43Z,@earowang I think complete_gaps() might be better than fill_gaps(). Would be more similar to tidyr::complete()

1071445933974585344,fchollet,2018-12-08T16:46:31Z,I think I should write a far longer and more specific follow-up to that post

1070325974506635264,wesmckinn,2018-12-05T14:36:12Z,There's a wide chasm between founders and employees. Founders generally have ~50-100x as much equity as any employee. Expecting employees to work as hard as the founders is where people run into problems

1065320376668848128,fchollet,2018-11-21T19:05:45Z,"In general, the TF team is quite large, with over 100 people (I think?), and none of them report to me. My scope is very narrow: looking at API changes within tf.keras, reviewing tf.keras code. That's really it."
1065320376035504128,fchollet,2018-11-21T19:05:44Z,"Another misconception I see is that I have a leadership position inside TensorFlow. I do not. I don’t actually make any important decisions with regard to TF, and never have. That’s the role of the TF leads, 5 people, of which I am not one."
1065320374773014529,fchollet,2018-11-21T19:05:44Z,"And then there are many more people elsewhere working on 3rd-party Keras implementations: the Keras-MXNet team at AWS, the Scala implementation from SkyMind, PlaidML, CoreML... As for me, I mostly do code reviews and I participate in design discussions."
1065320374131351552,fchollet,2018-11-21T19:05:44Z,"At Google, tf.keras (the internal TensorFlow implementation of the Keras spec) is made by 8 awesome engineers (come work with us!), and many more people contribute to it. And more great folks are working on the Keras TypeScript implementation as part of TensorFlow.js."
1065320373451862016,fchollet,2018-11-21T19:05:44Z,"A misconception I see is that Keras is made or owned by me. I may have started it a long time ago, but nowadays I do very little compared to everyone else. keras-team/keras has 750 contributors, including a dozen of very active ones. The Keras repo exists thanks to them."

1055687768632770560,fchollet,2018-10-26T05:09:12Z,"Similar to how, say, you can always reinvent the Pythagorean theorem on the fly if you think about geometry through the lens of vector products, or how you don't need to memorize the quadratic formula if you understand what an equation is and the general process for solving them"
1055687767718424576,fchollet,2018-10-26T05:09:12Z,"In addition, if you have the right mental model for something, it is generally easy to work out the algorithmic details on your own when you need them, at least down to a level where you can roll out a working implementation ( it becomes trivial if you can just look up details)"

1055678777521360896,fchollet,2018-10-26T04:33:28Z,"This is almost universally true: to understand something, you need the *right* mental models, that capture what *actually matters* about that thing, not just the lowest-level mathematical description you can find.

1055678775763988481,fchollet,2018-10-26T04:33:28Z,"My go-to example of this is PCA. If you know how to diagonalize a 5x5 matrix by hand, then you ""know the math"" behind PCA.

1055598142953938944,fchollet,2018-10-25T23:13:04Z,"Is it in bad taste to monetize open-source without giving back? Absolutely. Protesting it is just as bad, though. If you don't want people to reuse your code (and implicitly, profit from it), don't open-source it."

1042960438445527040,fchollet,2018-09-21T02:15:20Z,@Noahpinion You don't have to trust me. Just look at corruption scandals from the past 5 years in France and corruption scandals from the past 5 months in the US. The latter far surpass the former in gravity and scope.

To get rid of this limitation, you need to create your own network, where you would do less downsampling."
1042094306117287936,fchollet,2018-09-18T16:53:38Z,"@glagolista @jeremyphoward @graphific Thats means that all CNNs have a minimum input size, which is the minimum size you can call the network on without resulting in empty feature maps.

1035222404216188928,wesmckinn,2018-08-30T17:47:09Z,@abdullahalger @IBM @IBMcloud @TheASF I have observed that many developers inside big companies in some cases are unable to engage openly with open source projects. They have to build stuff then go through a approval / sign-off process to put it out there
1035222150116868096,wesmckinn,2018-08-30T17:46:08Z,"@abdullahalger @IBM @IBMcloud @TheASF Perhaps we have a different interpretation of what ""private"" means in this context. Workflows on top of cloud object stores is an important use case, I hope to coalesce collective efforts around this (to create reusable tooling)"
1035215065278902272,wesmckinn,2018-08-30T17:17:59Z,@abdullahalger @IBM @IBMcloud @TheASF My comment stands. It would be great to see more people from IBM engaged with the community. Planning and executing on projects in private can result in duplicated efforts. We are building a CSV library in Arrow for example
1035211533461188609,wesmckinn,2018-08-30T17:03:57Z,@abdullahalger @IBM @IBMcloud Sad to see effort fragmented across so many places. There's a community of Python developers working on this in @TheASF already. Other parts of IBM have done better (eg Spark/Arrow integration)

1035005872504619008,wesmckinn,2018-08-30T03:26:44Z,@dzj_evalparse @8bitscollider @ApacheArrow The Python datatable uses a custom memory format (distinct from R's data.table) and memory mapping protocol. It'd be great to have fst as a C++-only library so we can use it from Arrow-land

1033853150594195456,fchollet,2018-08-26T23:06:13Z,"To use a trivial example, don't use convolution layers on structured data, as you will be ignoring many important correlations across features that are not spatially close in your original encoding of the data, but that are close in information space."
1033853149604274176,fchollet,2018-08-26T23:06:13Z,Making assumptions about the structure of correlations in the data will *reduce* the expressiveness of the model (that's the point: dramatically reduce the search space to make search more data-efficient and faster). Which is why it is important to make *correct* assumptions.

1033536978229243905,fchollet,2018-08-26T02:09:52Z,"For instance, convolution is preferable to dense layers for data dimensions that are locally autocorrelated and translation-invariant. And depthwise separable convolutions are superior to convolution for any data that is locally autocorrelated and where channels are decorrelated."

1032598529531891713,hadleywickham,2018-08-23T12:00:48Z,@rtelmore Ooh good idea. Let me think about it
1032509790767828995,fchollet,2018-08-23T06:08:11Z,"@twitskeptic @earnmyturns The fact that DNA (with its limited capacity) can store generative programs for the body  brain is evidence that these systems are not very large in information terms, and that implies that the brain does not store much knowledge about the world, since that would be high-entropy"
1032503772193349635,fchollet,2018-08-23T05:44:16Z,"@earnmyturns However efficient the compression mechanism being used, and even taking into account the interaction with information that's external to our DNA, it remains that a pre-trained connectome would have a certain entropy, and that our DNA has limited entropic capacity."
1032477215789801472,fchollet,2018-08-23T03:58:45Z,"@benczheng Yes, our knowledge, as well as huge swathes of our intelligence itself (in particular most of what makes us special as humans compared to animals) are externalized in our civilization. It's not about individual brains, it's about the collective, past and present"
1032474589668896768,fchollet,2018-08-23T03:48:19Z,"That's also why it is of limited interest to study insect brains in order to understand cognition: understanding how brains can learn, and understanding how a specific connectome can generate complex behavior, are two independent, nearly unrelated problems."
1032472937339604992,fchollet,2018-08-23T03:41:45Z,"A pre-trained connectome developed by evolution is how insects work, but not humans; that approach is extremely behavior-centric and pretty limited in what sort of knowledge it can produce.

The innate part of human cognition is mostly about how to learn -- not knowledge itself."
1032472935481503744,fchollet,2018-08-23T03:41:44Z,"3) there just isn't a lot of storage space in the part of your DNA that's related to your brain; it's a few megabytes, so you couldn't store much in terms of pre-trained connectome"
1032472933451554816,fchollet,2018-08-23T03:41:44Z,"2) as brains change, so does the world; evolutionary scales (# of trials required by evolution as a search process) are too long to stumble upon adequate knowledge for the current state of world, so such knowledge would have to be limited to long-term invariants (which are few)"
1032472932054753281,fchollet,2018-08-23T03:41:44Z,"1) evolution is not conducive to producing knowledge (while it is good at finding behaviors), because the evolutionary advantage of any knowledge that's not immediately actionable (i.e. behaviors) is small"
1032472930800656384,fchollet,2018-08-23T03:41:43Z,"Knowledge cannot be passed on via your DNA to our descendants (obviously), so any innate knowledge about the world found in our brains must have been found through natural evolution. But..."
1032447555106308097,fchollet,2018-08-23T02:00:53Z,@jeffgaisano Humans are not insects; the few megabytes of brain-related information in your DNA define *how to learn* but contain relatively little *knowledge* -- and only animal-like basics. (reasons: can't pass on knowledge via DNA; not enough space; evolutionary scales not long enough)
1032445365092409344,fchollet,2018-08-23T01:52:11Z,The next frontier is the top left corner.
1032444572306042880,fchollet,2018-08-23T01:49:02Z,"Schematically, this is my point "
1032437967829135361,fchollet,2018-08-23T01:22:47Z,"@malcgreaves Yes, that would be new and significant, but also almost certainly not doable with differentiable programming"
1032435493244293121,fchollet,2018-08-23T01:12:57Z,"It just moves the threshold for ""have we drawn enough data yet"" by a bit -- by no more than a few orders of magnitude. But when infinite data is available, this is ""just"" the size of your cloud computing bill."
1032435492296347648,fchollet,2018-08-23T01:12:57Z,"Note that the question of model choice (the structure of the differentiable architecture used) is rather secondary, because as long as memorization capacity is sufficient, *any* model will do -- if there is training data to match. Even a single hidden Dense layer."
1032435491281428481,fchollet,2018-08-23T01:12:57Z,"Thus, the question of failure or success boils down to ""have we drawn enough training data yet?"" (or in some cases, ""does our architecture have sufficient capacity  appropriate structure wrt the training data available?""). Whether the answer is yes or no, it teaches us nothing."
1032435490484498432,fchollet,2018-08-23T01:12:57Z,"Can differentiable programming learn arbitrarily complex behaviors, up to superhuman performance, given a dense sampling of the behavior manifold (e.g. an infinite training data generator, such as self-play)?

Yes. We knew that. Arguably AlphaGo was the concrete proof-of-concept."

1026460558919442432,hadleywickham,2018-08-06T13:30:42Z,@markvdloo @henrikbengtsson Part of the problem is that the readme doesn’t currently include a direct comparison to base R. I’ll add that shortly

Focusing on skill is a bit like looking only at the speed of a vehicle but ignoring its energy consumption."

1022718321077022721,fchollet,2018-07-27T05:40:23Z,"It isn't very interesting that an algorithm can beat any human at chess -- but it would be significant to see an algorithm infer the rules of chess after looking at a few dozens of games, then proceed to develop a human-level chess solver using just a few hundreds of games"
1022718319646785536,fchollet,2018-07-27T05:40:23Z,"Skill is boring -- of course any dumb algorithm can reach arbitrary skill levels when leveraging arbitrary amounts of compute, data, and human engineering. You're trading off intelligence for experience."
1022718318032039936,fchollet,2018-07-27T05:40:22Z,I think lots of simple problems can serve as appropriate AI benchmarks (including chess) as long as we constrain them to measure *generalization power* and not *skill*.

It's not a straw man, it's a surprisingly common position. Before RNNs were cool, the ""universal approximator"" argument was being used in the same way to say that NNs were sufficient for AGI."

The choice of an appropriate search space  encoding/structure for that space is the most important part of any search process. DL does not have an optimization problem."

1010989790139899904,fchollet,2018-06-24T20:55:23Z,"So statements like ""NNs are universal approximators (or, 'there are Turing-complete RNN architectures'), therefore DL has no limits"" is like saying ""you can use a pen  some paper to produce the complete works of Shakespeare"". Technically true, but pretty silly at the same time."
1010989041922109441,fchollet,2018-06-24T20:52:25Z,"Second, it is not relevant whether a program *can be represented* (that's almost always true), one care whether a program *can be developed* (not just in theory, but in practice) using a particular approach."

That statement is utterly useless, too, because only very simple programs can be *learned* from finite data in practice (every tried training a LSTM to sort arbitrary lists?)."

1010662308412919808,fchollet,2018-06-23T23:14:06Z,@vkhosla @BenedictEvans In short term we'll see a trend towards AI systems that blend handcrafted symbolic models of the world together with deep learning modules for perception/intuition (self-driving cars are a good example). But these are engineering-intensive.

1010279371620274176,fchollet,2018-06-22T21:52:26Z,Most interesting processes cannot be learned by a stack of affine transforms (plus squashing functions) mapping one vector space to another point-by-point. Even given large amounts of data.
1010278944782708737,fchollet,2018-06-22T21:50:45Z,Deep learning is useful because it enables us to create programs that we could not otherwise code by hand. But the space of programs you can learn via deep learning models is a minuscule slice of the space of programs that we may be interested in.

And for those who do (jerks and trolls), it has little to do with the opinion itself."
1005341775173566464,fchollet,2018-06-09T06:52:12Z,"Out of hundreds of decent people, a single serial jerk or harasser can cause an awful amount of stress. 

Lessons: 1) don't be a jerk. 2) it's okay to opt out of such interactions if you can. You don't have a duty to engage with people who are hostile towards you."

Also, I think that if someone is being a jerk, it's your right to refuse to interact with them. You don't have to engage with someone who's being openly, repeatedly hostile."

1004795302086205440,fchollet,2018-06-07T18:40:42Z,A little bit of controversy is acceptable. It is often through debate and controversy that we end up defining more clearly where we stand and what we believe in. Controversy also forces us to periodically reconsider our values -- and that's good; values are not dogma.
1004794930626084864,fchollet,2018-06-07T18:39:14Z,"The first step is to think about values. Too many people are going out of their way to avoid having to ask these questions, or to avoid openly endorsing any principle that might be controversial (including fundamental humanistic values that until recently were widely accepted)."
1004793654974689280,fchollet,2018-06-07T18:34:10Z,"It seems a lot of the ethics issues we're facing in the world of 2018 originate from a general unwillingness to have clear values and to stand by them. Know what you value, stay true to it."

Also: use of weak benchmarks; impossibility to clearly link an empirical result to the big idea proposed by a paper (because of too many moving parts)"
1003718611179958276,fchollet,2018-06-04T19:22:19Z,"If publishing your paper requires you to select specific ideas, architectures, and hyperparameters according to a fixed validation set, then it's not longer a validation set, it's a training set. And there are no guarantees that the selected ideas will generalize to real data."

1003441332323377152,fchollet,2018-06-04T01:00:31Z,"It's not that deep learning is intrinsically incapable of driving -- it's that the situation space is extremely high-dimensional (due to edge cases), and that a deep learning system requires to be trained on a *dense sampling* of the same space that the system will operate in."

Businesses should place protecting the people who depend on them *before* making money. And that's an ethics issue, not a business model issue."

No, the problem is disrespecting the fundamental rights of customers. Which points to moral dereliction and may require regulations."

994273408627064832,fchollet,2018-05-09T17:50:27Z,The words we use to name things change our perception of those things independently of their actual nature. A lot of the hype and mystique around AI is due to our use of terminology from the fields of neuroscience and psychology.

990993918790529024,fchollet,2018-04-30T16:38:56Z,"There are many reasons why Japan is able to build the sort of vertical housing  associated infrastructure (esp mass public transportation) that enables affordable, liveable high-density megacities.

990977012083838977,fchollet,2018-04-30T15:31:45Z,"In other words, the argument ""deep learning is overhyped; there are things it will remain fundamentally unable to do because it's just a GFR"" has a specific meaning, it's not handwaving that would apply to any learning system"
990975284605206529,fchollet,2018-04-30T15:24:53Z,Deep learning is a giant fancy regression (GFR). But lots of things aren't. Most software running on your computer isn't a GFR. Large chunks of the field of AI isn't about GFR. And your brain isn't a GFR (though it may implement something like it as a small part of what it does).

It consumes more energy than the entire banking industry (0.5% of the world's electricity or so) while serving ~0% of the market. And while being more centralized than banking

989859504652144644,fchollet,2018-04-27T13:31:11Z,One reason I wish the Bitcoin bubble would deflate sooner: it has created a financial incentive for anyone with access to resources they don't pay for (power source or computers) to abuse them in the most inefficient way possible. This will continue to be extremely destructive

989225226490687488,KimKardashian,2018-04-25T19:30:47Z,Kanye will never run in the race of popular opinion and we know that and that’s why I love him and respect him and in a few years when someone else says the same exact thing but they aren’t labeled the way he is  and you will all praise them! Kanye is years ahead of his time
989225120282558464,KimKardashian,2018-04-25T19:30:22Z,"Now when he spoke out about Trump... Most people (including myself) have very different feelings  opinions about this. But this is HIS opinion.  I believe in people being able to have their own opinions,even if really different from mine
He never said he agrees with his politics"
989221660661137408,KimKardashian,2018-04-25T19:16:37Z,"He’s a free thinker, is that not allowed in America? Because some of his ideas differ from yours you have to throw in the mental health card? That’s just not fair. He’s actually out of the sunken place when he’s being himself which is very expressive"
989220992235941889,KimKardashian,2018-04-25T19:13:58Z,Yesterday it was announced that Kanye had parted ways with some business people and media outlets made this about Kanye’s mental health. Rather than just a simple business decision. So I’m glad he tweeted about the state of his company and all of the exciting things happening
989220790741553152,KimKardashian,2018-04-25T19:13:10Z,To the media trying to demonize my husband let me just say this... your commentary on Kanye being erratic  his tweets being disturbing is actually scary. So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair

You can go a very long way without math (maybe all the way, if you have code instead). But if you master math, that's a key advantage you should leverage"
989169111434330113,fchollet,2018-04-25T15:47:48Z,"You can think rigorously without mathematical notation.

Inversely, some math-heavy papers use math to obfuscate a lack of rigor -- leveraging the fact that it's harder to read for most, and that it confers an appearance of scientificness."

Math notation as a cargo-cult token of rigor.

But math, like figures, like English, is just a language to express and develop ideas."

985957197321392128,fchollet,2018-04-16T19:04:48Z,"That doesn't mean trying to understand how the brain works isn't going to help us understand cognition. If anything, it can be an interesting source of inspiration.

But it means that's just one avenue among many. And I'd bet it's not the one that's going to get us there first."
985956463548878848,fchollet,2018-04-16T19:01:53Z,"Much like boolean algebra isn't fundamental to computing  programming in an abstract sense, but rather is an arbitrary low-level design choice, I don't think brains are fundamental to intelligence. I'd posit the most compact substrate for defining cognition is mathematics."

At a lower-level, most models seem to use way more ops/params than they need, and backprop + SGD itself is fundamentally inefficient"
985619973623070720,fchollet,2018-04-15T20:44:48Z,"@Grady_Booch We're still exploring the space of problems we can solve, but I think that was mostly 2014-2016 (while 2011-2013 was ""wow, it works""). DL is now a well-established solution for a certain scope of problems, but still a very inefficient one (data-inefficient, power-inefficient...)"
985609870689759232,fchollet,2018-04-15T20:04:39Z,"In AI, we're at stage 0 (groundwork). In deep learning, I'd say we're still at the ""make it efficient"" stage, so efforts to make it invisible  fully-automated may be premature in my opinion. We still need the monthly power consumption of a village to ""solve"" CIFAR10 from scratch"

985261183014809600,fchollet,2018-04-14T20:59:05Z,"Lots of replies to these tweets are along the lines of: ""you arrogant fascist, why do you hate discussion and debate and free speech"". I find immense value in open discussions, but seriously, if you think that's how Twitter replies are used, we must not be using the same app."
985245637779206144,fchollet,2018-04-14T19:57:19Z,"Twitter has highly adversarial reply dynamics. It's a playground for trolls, and often even awakens the latent troll in regular people. Like news sites with unmoderated replies, it gives an audience to the most toxic, agenda-driven posters. We need to be able to opt-out of that."

985213109664079872,fchollet,2018-04-14T17:48:04Z,"Hence the fascination for ""human-level intelligence"" in AI. What they mean is ""civilized human"", the intelligence of which is 95% the civilization and 5% the human"
985212489372655616,fchollet,2018-04-14T17:45:36Z,"As conscious subjects, we are extremely biased to believe that we owe our capabilities and our understanding of the world to our own individual intelligence. When in fact, we can do very little and we know very little on our own. It's collective intelligence all the way."

984529181135351808,fchollet,2018-04-12T20:30:23Z,"There's a quote by Alan Watts -- ""this is the real secret of life -- to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play"".

In that view, kids have life figured out. But then they forget."
984529019226865665,fchollet,2018-04-12T20:29:44Z,"Adults have their minds full of abstractions: other people and their mental states, future planning and worries, past memories... adults exist on a much wider plane, mostly made of non-things, or things that aren't here and now. They glaze over their surroundings."
984528815077539840,fchollet,2018-04-12T20:28:55Z,Another big one is presence and embodiment. The things you see and the things you don't see. Kids tend to be pretty focused on their immediate environment and the sensorimotor affordances it enables. Adult cognition is much more abstract and less embodied.
984528662690017280,fchollet,2018-04-12T20:28:19Z,"Another obvious difference is physical viewpoint. As a kid, you're a lot closer to the ground, and you perceive spaces as much larger. You're effectively living in a quite different physical space than the adults towering above you"
984528543819358208,fchollet,2018-04-12T20:27:51Z,"A big one is time. Our perception of time is shaped by the experience of long sequences of recurring markers, and a lack of that means kids don't have much temporal perspective. They live in the present, where hours stretch forever, and periods of years are inconceivable"
984528457869639681,fchollet,2018-04-12T20:27:30Z,"Thinking of some of the ways in which young kids (say, a 7 year-old) experience reality radically differently from adults. Late stages of development (and memories of going through them) are full of important insights about cognition"

984227236130598912,fchollet,2018-04-12T00:30:33Z,"2) Human augmentation vs. replacement. Organizations should be ambitious in how they use automation, and seek to turn workers into hyper-productive ""AI supervisors"" (using AI to add value), rather than merely automating the work they used to be doing (using AI for cost-cutting)."
984227088071716864,fchollet,2018-04-12T00:29:58Z,"1) Democratization vs. centralization. AI should be a tool in the hand of everyone (like the open Internet and open personal computing), rather than being controlled by a small number of large companies and governments."

981714535647068160,fchollet,2018-04-05T02:05:59Z,"It's a bit like saying, ""oh, hosting the Olympics is such a boon for a city's infrastructure"". Have you considered that directly investing in infrastructure independently of the Olympics might be more capital-efficient (fewer oversized stadiums and more subway lines)?"
981713963011293184,fchollet,2018-04-05T02:03:42Z,Many are asserting that military funding is a wonderful vector of progress because many civilian technologies have their origins in military RD. Do you think that investing the same (staggering) amount of money in civilian RD directly would somehow have been less beneficial?
981688864883593217,KimKardashian,2018-04-05T00:23:58Z,I can't believe tomorrow is the launch of our KKW Beauty x Mario collab!

981648043027062784,fchollet,2018-04-04T21:41:46Z,A proper mathematical theory of abstraction should provide formal ways to quantify generalization.
981647839045476352,fchollet,2018-04-04T21:40:57Z,"Information theory provides a nice way to quantify this, but it's not the only possible avenue"
981647608518094849,fchollet,2018-04-04T21:40:02Z,"Intelligence is the degree of efficiency with which a learning system turns experience (data) into generalizable programs. I = G / E

In AI, ""system"" should be understood as including the human engineers. Most of the ""data -&gt; generalization"" conversion happens during model design"

981582989913096197,KimKardashian,2018-04-04T17:23:16Z,We felt it was our classic look and most of our looks had brown hair so we wanted this vibe for the campaign. We shot it when I was still blonde and it was a wig! I was nervous lol

976933782367293440,fchollet,2018-03-22T21:28:58Z,"AI will be our interface to the world -- a world made of digital information. This can equally lead to empowering individuals and communities to gain greater control over their lives, or to a total loss of agency. And regrettably, we're currently engaged on the wrong road"
976933095780769792,fchollet,2018-03-22T21:26:15Z,"In the long-run, education and self-development will be some of the most impactful applications of AI. This will happen through dynamics that almost entirely mirror that of a nefarious AI-enabled newsfeed trying to control you. Only difference being who sets the algorithm's goals"
976932503645601792,fchollet,2018-03-22T21:23:54Z,"It should be possible for users to configure their newsfeed to maximize learning and personal growth, for instance (or anything else). In that case, a more sophisticated AI, instead of being a threat, would be beneficial to you -- letting you achieve your goals more efficiently."
976931881831751681,fchollet,2018-03-22T21:21:25Z,"Rather than letting newsfeed algorithms manipulate us to achieve opaque goals (such as swaying your political opinions, or maximally wasting your time), we should put the user in control of the goals that the algorithms optimize for."
976931081399054342,fchollet,2018-03-22T21:18:14Z,"The problem is not so much that we are increasingly relying on algorithms to be our interface with an increasingly information-intensive world. With the rise of the Internet and AI, his trend is inevitable. The issue is control."

976808131966767105,wesmckinn,2018-03-22T13:09:41Z,Exciting development today: @ApacheArrow for Go 
976804739944869888,fchollet,2018-03-22T12:56:12Z,"@Pinboard is how you keep in touch with your friends, and it can (does) use what your friends say in order to manipulate you (social reinforcement). Harder to avoid, far more insidious and far more effective"
976804336117297154,fchollet,2018-03-22T12:54:36Z,"@Pinboard Agree that YT has a problem (and I hope we'll see it fixed soon). But you can't compare YT to FB. Propaganda on YT is like propaganda on Fox News: it's strangers yelling at you on a screen, and you can just turn off the TV. FB, on the other hand, ... (Cont)"
976786099254181888,fchollet,2018-03-22T11:42:08Z,"So please get over the knee-jerk reaction ""all tech/advertising is bad"", and think about the contents of the thread. 

For me, working at Google is a deliberate choice. If I start feeling uncomfortable, I'll definitely leave. If I had been working at FB, I would have left in 2017"
976785289401135105,fchollet,2018-03-22T11:38:55Z,"There's only one company where the product is an opaque algorithmic newsfeed, that has been running large-scale mood/opinion manipulation experiments, that is neck-deep in an election manipulation scandal, that has shown time and time again to have morally bankrupt leadership."
976784465245515776,fchollet,2018-03-22T11:35:38Z,"Essentially nothing about the threat described applies to Google. Nor Amazon. Nor Apple. 

It could apply to Twitter, in principle, but in practice it almost entirely doesn't."
976783608219279360,fchollet,2018-03-22T11:32:14Z,About this thread. Some say this applies to Google too. This is the laziest kind of thinking -- just because two things share some superficial similarity (they're large tech cos) doesn't mean they're equivalent. Reminds me of pundits who kept saying HRC and DJT were just as bad

976569525129768960,KimKardashian,2018-03-21T21:21:33Z,"Don’t miss an all new GLAM MASTERS tonight on Lifetime! So excited that my make up artist in London, the one  only @lisaeldridgemakeup fills in for Mario the night! "
976569442728525824,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:21:13Z,"We’re looking at a powerful entity that builds fine-grained psychological profiles of over two billion humans, that runs large-scale behavior manipulation experiments, and that aims at developing the best AI technology the world has ever seen. Personally, it really scares me"
976569278328549378,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:20:34Z,"Who knows what will be next. It is quite striking that Facebook has been investing enormous amounts in AI research and development, with the explicit goal of becoming a leader in the field. What does that tell you? What do you use AI/RL for when your product is a newsfeed?"
976569107591000064,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:19:53Z,"AI has been making fast progress in recent years, and that progress is only beginning to get deployed in targeting algorithms and social media bots. Deep learning has only started to make its way into newsfeeds and ad networks around 2016. Facebook has invested massively in it"
976568975302713344,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:19:22Z,"It is the reason why so many of the ads you see online seem desperately irrelevant. They aren't that sophisticated. Likewise, the social media bots used by hostile state actors to sway public opinion have little to no AI in them. They’re all extremely primitive. For now."
976568799141904384,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:18:40Z,"Until 2015, all ad targeting algorithms across the industry were running on mere logistic regression. In fact, that’s still true to a large extent today -- only the biggest players have switched to more advanced models."
976568706967851008,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:18:18Z,"So, if mass population control is already possible today -- in theory -- why hasn’t the world ended yet? In short, I think it’s because we’re really bad at AI. But that may be about to change. You see, our technical capabilities are the bottleneck here."
976568588378152960,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:17:49Z,"Importantly, mass population control -- in particular political control -- arising from placing AI algorithms in charge of our information diet does not necessarily require very advanced AI. You don’t need self-aware, superintelligent AI for this to be a dire threat."
976568469679357952,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:17:21Z,"The human mind is a static, vulnerable system that will come increasingly under attack from ever-smarter AI algorithms that will simultaneously have a complete view of everything we do and believe, and complete control of the information we consume."
976568410287915008,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:17:07Z,"In the case of the human mind, these vulnerabilities never get patched, they are just the way we work. They’re in our DNA. They're our psychology. On a personal level, we have no practical way to defend ourselves against them."
976568080095576064,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:15:48Z,"Some of them have been used for a long time in advertising (e.g. positive/negative social reinforcement), but in a very weak, un-targeted form. From an information security perspective, you would call these ""vulnerabilities"": known exploits that can be used to take over a system."
976567871626031105,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:14:59Z,"This is made all the easier by the fact that the human mind is highly vulnerable to simple patterns of social manipulation. While thinking about these issues, I have compiled a short list of psychological attack patterns that would be devastatingly effective"
976567757109051392,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:14:31Z,"A good chunk of the field of AI research (especially the bits that Facebook has been investing in) is about developing algorithms to solve such optimization problems as efficiently as possible, to close the loop and achieve full control of the phenomenon at hand. In this case, us"
976567526023872513,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:13:36Z,"A loop in which you observe the current state of your targets and keep tuning what information you feed them, until you start observing the opinions and behaviors you wanted to see"
976565723597176832,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:06:26Z,"In short, Facebook can simultaneously measure everything about us, and control the information we consume. When you have access to both perception and action, you’re looking at an AI problem. You can start establishing an optimization loop for human behavior. A RL loop."
976565553761476608,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:05:46Z,"This is not quite news, as Facebook has been known to run since at least 2013 a series of experiments in which they were able to successfully control the moods and decisions of unwitting users by tuning their newsfeeds’ contents, as well as prediction user's future decisions"
976565324622344192,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:04:51Z,"If Facebook gets to decide, over the span of many years, which news you will see (real or fake), whose political status updates you’ll see, and who will see yours, then Facebook is in effect in control of your political beliefs and your worldview"
976565165922512897,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:04:13Z,"Integrated over many years of exposure, the algorithmic curation of the information we consume gives the systems in charge considerable power over our lives, over who we become. By moving our lives to the digital realm, we become vulnerable to that which rules it -- AI algorithms"
976564511858597888,fchollet,2018-03-21T21:01:37Z,"These two trends overlap at the level of the algorithms that shape our digital content consumption. Opaque social media algorithms get to decide, to an ever-increasing extent, which articles we read, who we keep in touch with, whose opinions we read, whose feedback we get"
976564096605679616,fchollet,2018-03-21T20:59:58Z,"The world is being shaped in large part by two long-time trends: first, our lives are increasingly dematerialized, consisting of consuming and generating information online, both at work and at home. Second, AI is getting ever smarter."
976563870322999296,fchollet,2018-03-21T20:59:05Z,"The problem with Facebook is not *just* the loss of your privacy and the fact that it can be used as a totalitarian panopticon. The more worrying issue, in my opinion, is its use of digital information consumption as a psychological control vector. Time for a thread"
976558809878380544,fchollet,2018-03-21T20:38:58Z,"As a member of the AI research community: next you participate in Facebook's AI ecosystem in any way, think about what you are enabling. You are feeding a monster that may end up eating us all. Sorry if I sound dramatic, but the threat level we face deserves that vocabulary."
976557101995630592,fchollet,2018-03-21T20:32:11Z,"If there's one AI risk you should be worried about, this is it: extremely effective, scalable population control. And the fact that Facebook has been attempting to become a leader in AI is genuinely terrifying when you can see the full extent of the implications"
976555676741718016,fchollet,2018-03-21T20:26:31Z,"Facebook has been running for a long time a very ""successful"" series of experiments about using the newsfeed to control users' moods and opinions, as well as predicting users' future decisions (e.g. predicting breakups and new relationships) "

974547801752285185,fchollet,2018-03-16T07:27:56Z,"@michael_nielsen Leadership as ""setting directions, values, providing inspiration"" does not require a hierarchical structure at all. Anyone can lead. Some scifi writers are in fact powerful leaders in that sense. And of course, so is Disney. One of the most powerful entity in the world"
974546094326669312,fchollet,2018-03-16T07:21:09Z,@michael_nielsen Sounds like mentorship or coaching to me. Leadership as I see it does set directions and values and does achieve well-defined goals. Maybe universities have no need of leaders in that sense?
974497543752052736,fchollet,2018-03-16T04:08:14Z,@greglinden Leading is largely about getting others to adopt your goals and values. It's about setting the direction.

910891238391508998,wesmckinn,2017-09-21T15:39:29Z,@akarve @ApacheArrow Orthogonal concerns. Use Weld to generate new kernel functions for the Arrow runtime
910891011987165184,wesmckinn,2017-09-21T15:38:35Z,@akarve @ApacheArrow I think trying to accommodate tensors would make the implementation far too complicated. Tables are hard enough. Happy to be proven wrong
